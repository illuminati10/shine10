Step1: 
compile the library source code into position-independent code (works no matter where in memory it is placed). 
gcc -c -Wall -Werror -fpic foo.c

Step2:
we need to turn this object file into a shared library. Weâ€™ll call it libfoo.so:
gcc -shared -o libfoo.so foo.o

Step3:
The -lfoo option looks for library file libfoo.so in the location specified by -L
gcc -L/home/ccc/Desktop/Marathon/lib -Wall -o dsv main.c -lfoo

Step4:
Change environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH for library path and export it.
1. LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/ccc/Desktop/Marathon/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
2. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/username/foo:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Step5:
./dsv

Output:
This is a shared library test...
Hello, I'm a shared library
